#
# Checks that <tag> in the upstream repo is an annotated tag whose signature
# GitHub verifies - the same rule upstream's own release workflow enforces -
# and prints the commit it points to. Exits 1 with a ::warning:: on stderr
# otherwise, so resolve-pending-releases.sh can skip the tag and carry on.
#
# Needs GH_TOKEN (any token; the upstream repo is public). Override the repo
# with UPSTREAM_REPO_SLUG.
